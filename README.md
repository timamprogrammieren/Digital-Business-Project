# ExploreRuhpolding
ExploreRuhpolding is a lightweight, bilingual (EN/DE) multi-page web app built with HTML5, modern CSS and vanilla ES6 JavaScript. It showcases Ruhpoldingâ€™s signature outdoor sports - trail running, mountain biking, climbing, paragliding and skiing - through rich hero sections, interactive Leaflet maps and on-page booking widgets. JavaScript powers the live language switcher, a persistent local-storage booking cart and the map initialisation, giving travellers a fast, backend-free experience that looks crisp and performs smoothly on any device.
